### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that Internet Explorer 8 only takes simple selectors so it is important to be sure what you implement is compatible with the system you use. 
2. You can use an empty string to remove values you don't want implemented -- ("").
3. There are parent nodes, child nodes, and sibling nodes. Child nodes are to be attached to parent nodes.
